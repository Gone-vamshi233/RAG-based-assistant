üìù **Project Publication: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Assistant**
üìå **Abstract**

This project is part of the Agentic AI Developer Certification (AAIDC) Module 1 and demonstrates the development of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Assistant. The assistant enhances AI reliability by combining document retrieval with natural language generation, producing accurate and context-aware responses.

üîç **Introduction**

Large Language Models (LLMs) are powerful but often prone to hallucinations, generating incorrect or unverifiable answers. This project addresses that challenge by implementing a RAG architecture, grounding responses in actual documents. The goal is to showcase how retrieval mechanisms can be integrated with LLMs to build fact-based, trustworthy assistants.

‚öôÔ∏è **System Overview**
The workflow of the RAG Assistant begins with document loading, where text files (.txt) are ingested from a designated folder. Once the documents are available, they undergo chunking, a process of splitting them into smaller segments. This step is crucial because it ensures that the content fits within token limits while also improving retrieval granularity.

Next, each chunk is converted into a semantic vector using OpenAI Embeddings. These embeddings capture the meaning of the text rather than just the raw words. Once generated, the embeddings are stored in Chroma, a vector database designed for fast and efficient similarity searches.

When a user submits a query, the system performs retrieval, pulling the most relevant chunks based on semantic similarity. These retrieved chunks are then passed as context to a large language model (LLM) such as GPT-3.5 via LangChain. Finally, the LLM generates a response that is both accurate and natural-sounding, grounded in the retrieved documents rather than hallucinated knowledge.

**Tools & Frameworks**

This project integrates several modern AI frameworks and libraries to deliver the RAG pipeline. LangChain acts as the workflow orchestrator, connecting the components seamlessly. OpenAI Embeddings provide high-quality semantic vectorization of document chunks, while Chroma serves as the vector database, storing embeddings and enabling similarity-based retrieval. For the user interface, Streamlit is used to build an interactive and accessible front end that allows users to query the assistant in real time.

üíª **Installation Instructions**

1. Clone the repository:
   git clone https://github.com/gone-vamshi233/rag-assistant.git
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   cd rag-assistant
3. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # macOS/Linux
   venv\Scripts\activate     # Windows
4. Install dependencies:
   pip install -r requirements.txt
5. Add your OpenAI API key in a .env file:
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   
üöÄ **Usage Instructions**:
1. Add your text documents to the `data/` folder.
2. Run the Streamlit app:
   streamlit run app.py
3. Type your query in the input box to get context-aware answers.
   
  **Maintenance & Support Details**

maintaining the assistant involves a few simple steps. Whenever new documents need to be added, place them in the data/ folder and rebuild the embeddings to ensure they are included in retrieval. If the assistant produces incomplete or missing answers, double-check that all relevant documents have been uploaded and processed. For API-related issues, confirm that the .env file contains a valid OpenAI API key. These steps ensure smooth and reliable performance of the system.

‚ú® **Key Features**

The RAG Assistant offers several notable features. It produces context-aware responses, grounding each answer in retrieved documents to minimize hallucinations. The system is modular, meaning that components such as the LLM, embeddings, or vector database can be easily replaced without major rework. It is also scalable, allowing new documents to be added and embeddings updated dynamically as the knowledge base grows. Finally, it provides a user-friendly interface through Streamlit, enabling intuitive and interactive querying for end users.

üìö **Example Use Case**

Scenario: A knowledge base of company policies is loaded into the system.

User Query: ‚ÄúWhat is the company‚Äôs leave policy for interns?‚Äù

RAG Assistant Response: Retrieves and cites the specific policy from documents, providing a concise, reliable answer.

This illustrates how the assistant can support education, enterprise knowledge management, and research assistance.

üß™ **Evaluation & Best Practices**

The assistant follows best practices to ensure reliable performance. Document chunking is used to optimize token usage and improve retrieval accuracy. The semantic similarity search mechanism ensures that even when queries are phrased differently, the most relevant information is still retrieved. Grounded answers significantly reduce the hallucinations that often occur in pure LLM-based systems. Moreover, the modular pipeline allows easy integration with new tools and APIs, making the system adaptable for evolving use cases.

**Embedding Model Choice Explanation**

For semantic vectorization, the project uses OpenAI‚Äôs text-embedding-3-small model. This choice strikes a balance between computational efficiency and embedding quality, ensuring fast yet accurate retrieval. For response generation, GPT-3.5 is employed to produce fluent, context-aware answers. Together, this combination reduces hallucinations while maintaining high-quality outputs, making it well-suited for real-world applications where factual reliability is critical.

**Memory Mechanisms Explanation**
  
The system incorporates lightweight memory mechanisms to keep responses grounded and context-aware. Retrieved document chunks act as temporary contextual memory for each query. For every user question, the system retrieves the top-k most relevant chunks from Chroma, ensuring that the LLM only considers the most important information.

This retrieved context is then injected into the prompt, enabling the LLM to generate an informed response. In longer conversations, the assistant can append previous query‚Äìresponse pairs, effectively building a short-term memory of the session. This design balances efficiency with contextual accuracy, avoiding unnecessary computational overhead while still maintaining continuity in dialogue.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Limitations**

Despite its strengths, the system has certain limitations. Its effectiveness depends largely on the quality and coverage of the uploaded documents. If the dataset is incomplete, the assistant‚Äôs responses will also be limited. Performance can degrade when handling very large datasets or queries that are highly ambiguous. At present, the assistant is optimized for plain text files, though future iterations could extend support to multiple formats such as PDF or CSV.

üìä**Retrieval Evaluation**

The retrieval performance of the system is evaluated across multiple metrics. Precision measures the proportion of retrieved chunks that are truly relevant, ensuring the system avoids irrelevant or noisy context. Recall assesses how many of the relevant chunks were successfully retrieved, which is crucial for comprehensive answers. The F1-score, calculated as the harmonic mean of precision and recall, provides a balanced measure of retrieval quality.

In addition to accuracy metrics, the system also tracks latency, which refers to the time taken to retrieve the top-k chunks from the database. Keeping latency low is important for maintaining a smooth and responsive user experience.
